            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Duke Matunda. I am 21 years of age and I am from Kenya. I recently came to the states to get my
                Degree from here because American Degrees hold great value and they are recognized internationally. I was a bit
                scared of the prgramming in this class but once I went through the first programming activity my nerves have 
                calmed down.
