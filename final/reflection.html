    One of the things I learned was ensuring consistency and compatability accross diffrent devices.

    I got to understand how to come up with a website  and how to modify it to fit my requirements.

    Learning CSS media queries has been a game changer for me in understanding responsive design.

    By using media queries I can adapt a websites layout to diffrent sizes so I can ensure an optimal user experience on any device.
</li>
<li>Creating websites from the ground up like this one has been a hands on way to apply what I have learned.  </li>

    I have stumbbled upon mutliple roadblacks throughout my Lab work throughout the semester but with the help of Prof.Noone and I finally figured out my errors and I overcame them.
</li>
<li>Brainstomring my assignments led me to develop my troubleshooting skills since most of the time I was using the trial and error method to and it worked every time</li>
